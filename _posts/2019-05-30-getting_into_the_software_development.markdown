Before I get into why I choose software development. Here's a background of myself, I’m currently living in NY working at a corporation that develops aftermarket actuators for large aircraft manufacturers. After I graduated college with my mechanical engineering degree, I didn't know what corporation or field of work I wanted to pursue. My decisions expanded from Aerospace, HVAC, Robotics or other mechanical related work.  I landed a job within an aerospace corporation to see if this would peak my interest.  After working with aftermarket parts, performing and generating environmental test for components. I realized this was not my path. 

So, I started dabbling into different work and hobbies to see where my interest would take me and what will stimulate my brain. I decided to immerse myself with coding after getting some exposure at work with Python and Matlab. The programs were used only to generate reports and analyze large amount of data from the test bench. This is when I realized how power and time efficient code development can improve work performance. In addition, with working on websites utilizing WordPress as my platform.  From there on, a fire sparked and I knew that my path was not in the mechanical world but with software development. 

I've always been fascinated with software applications, gaming and website development but realize the difficulty during my attempt to learn it. In order to help myself I needed to start with what I was missing, which was the fundamentals of coding or creating algorithms. But going back to school for computer science wasn’t practical for my lifestyle. I joined flatiron because I believe that this would help jumpstart my coding career by improving my skills, provide me with situations on real world applications, and give me the knowledge that would lead me on the right path to software development.  I’m ready to learn and generate code into real world applications!
