Why use a command line interface (CLI)  versus a graphical user interface (GUI)? Both tools have their advantages and disadvantages. You just  have to understand which one works best for the problem you are trying to solve. 

Most languages that you are dealing with should contain a  command line interface that can be used to communicate with the computer program through user commands. Usually, this is communicated through the utilization of command language interpreter, which is the program that allows the user to interface all the commands. 


* Memorization and familiarity is needed for operation and navigation, the user should already know the scripting of commands and sytnax
* Restricted to one window and will not be able to multitask different platforms
* Running code on the CLI is much faster in performance because it navigates and commands directly to the program.
* Takes less computer system resources 


GUI is more of a intuitive approach to solving a problem. It contains a visual based interface with feathers that uses windows, icons and menus to help. 


* This interfaces allows a user friendly windows that enable the user to view, control, manipulate, and toggle through mulitple programs and folders. 
* Faster way of learning how to use the program with a shorter learning curve.
* Will require more computing resources which will then to slow the program down. 


The common use of interface in modern day is GUI because the initutive nature and how fast a user can learn the most about the feathers of the program. Expert coders will only use CLI for speed and to access the program much faster but can be trival.
